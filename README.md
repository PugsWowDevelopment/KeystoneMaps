# KeystoneMaps

Keystone Maps is a dungeon planning addon based on the original work from Nnoggie
(https://github.com/Nnoggie/MythicDungeonTools)

Since the data support on the original project has been discontinued, this project aims at first continue to support dungeon data as the game evolves, and second to continue to evolve and provide meaningfull features.
